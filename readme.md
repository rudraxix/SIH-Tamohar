# TAMOHAR 

## OVERVIEW 

__TAMOHAR__ is a software solution designed to analyze and enhance low-light images of **PSR (Permanently Shadowed Regions) of the Lunar Craters** captured and extracted from the data of the OHRC (Obriter Hight Resolution Camera) sensor onboard Chandrayaan-2 satellite.

TAMOHAR aims to provide insights into the Moon's hidden regions and helps in aiming landing location on the Moon.

## DATASETS 

- ### Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) 
 The dataset includes high-resolution images of lunar surfaces which are critical for detecting hidden features such as craters, water/ice deposits, and potential landing sites.

- ### Orbital High Resolution Camera(OHRC)
 The High resolution data provided by the OHRC sensor is utilised for the training and testing of the model using the feature extraction for cropping out poorly lit regions of the Lunar surface specifically craters
- ### more datasets
